INTRODUCTION:
The vehicle seat monitoring system is capable of maintaining the heat in the vehicle seats. When the temperature is low the electronic designer should make sure that his equipment should work efficiently in that weather. In this project the  button sensor will sense is the driver or passenger seated or not and if the driver or passenger is seated then need to set the temperature accordingly by changing it .Based on that the controller will set the heater to required  temperature. The heater will generate the heat  and a LCD display will show requested the temperature.

FEATURES:
•	It is used for determining weather the user is present or not in the vehicle.
•	If the passenger or driver present in the vehicle then it will give the indication.
•	After giving the indication it will determine the heat .
•	Driver and passenger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
•	The passenger can modify temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system.
•	Low cost and robust system.

SWOT – Strengths ,weakness, opportunities and Threats.
Strengths:
•	It is easy to change the temperature inside the vehicle.
•	Low cost.
•	It is user friendly.
Weakness:
•	It is used  in the places where their is low temperature.
Opportunities:
•	It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC.

Threats:
•	It is not suitable for high temperature areas.
